# MyHomePlugin
Legrand (BTicino) MyHome plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

Legrand MyHome (http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/home.action) is an Home Automation solution that can manage:
- lighting (standard on/off/dimmed lights)
- thermoregulation 
- curtains, doors
- security systems

With this plugin, the support of a IP gateway installed in your plant and a configuration of all installed 
systems (MyHome does not support the autodiscovery of the system) you can control it. You need to disable the OpenWebNet password-based
authentication from the IP of the device that runs homebridge (ie. Raspberry) or set the auhentication to HMAC; 
HMAC authentication is supported by all recent IP gateways or older one with updated firmware (eg. F454 with v2 firmware).

# Installation (TBD)
Install plugin with npm install -g homebridge-myhome
Add platform within config.json of you homebridge instance:

    {
        "platforms": [{
            "platform": "MyHome Gateway",
            "ipaddress": "192.168.1.1",
            "password": "12345",
            "discovery": false,
            "devices": [
                    /*Static list of devices*/
                ]
            }], 
        "bridge": {
            "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:31", 
            "name": "MyHome HomeBridge Adapter", 
            "pin": "342-52-220", 
            "port": 51826
        }, 
        "description": "My Fantastic Legrand MyHome System", 
        "accessories": []
    }

Restart homebridge
Enjoy!

# Installation

Run as root:

    npm -g install homebridge-myhome-tng
   
Create your config.json file starting from the template (sample-config.json) and then:

    homebridge -U .

Sample log is:

    Scan this code with your HomeKit App on your iOS device to pair with Homebridge:

        ┌────────────┐
        │ 342-52-220 │
        └────────────┘

    [1/14/2017, 12:11:29 AM] Homebridge is running on port 51827.


## Configuration

Only the platforms section of the config.json file should be edited, the pair code and the port in bridge section can be ignored in most of the cases. A little sample:

    {
        "platforms": [{
            "platform": "LegrandMyHome",
            "ipaddress": "192.168.157.207",
            "port": 20000,
            "ownpassword": "12345",
            "discovery": false,
            "devices": [{
                "accessory": "MHRelay",
                "name": "Bathroom Light",
                "address": "0/1/5"
                },{
                "accessory": "MHRelay",
                "name": "Night hallway Light",
                "address": "0/1/1"
                },{
                "accessory": "MHRelay",
                "name": "Office",
                "address": "0/1/4"
                },{
                "accessory": "MHDimmer",
                "name": "Master bedroom Central",
                "address": "0/1/2"
                },{
                "accessory": "MHThermostat",
                "name": "Living Room Thermostat",
                "address": "21"
                },{
                "accessory": "MHThermostatExternal",
                "name": "External Thermo Sensor",
                "address": "1"
                }]
            }],
        "bridge": {
            "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:31", 
            "name": "MyHome HomeBridge Adapter", 
            "pin": "342-52-220", 
            "port": 51827
        }, 
        "description": "My MyHome Home System",
        "accessories": [
        ]
    }

The first part of the config file contains details about the MyHome Gateway used to interface the IP network with the plant:

        "platforms": [{
            "platform": "LegrandMyHome",
            "ipaddress": "192.168.157.207",
            "port": 20000,
            "ownpassword": "12345",
            "discovery": false,
            "devices": [{

You need to change:
- ipaddress: put the IP address or name of the MyHome Gateway (eg. F454 or MH201, I'm not so updated about all gateways that BTicino-Legrand releases after 2015); the IP should be static but in the future I can implement a UPNP dicovery because all gateways supports that method
- port: should be 20000 and keep this value
- ownpassword: the OpenWebNet password, default is 12345 but everyone will suggest to you to change it with another password (4 to 9 digits), but you will keep the default one, I know...
- discovery: boolean value, not supported but in the future allows the gateway to discover the plant and detect most of devices
- devices: list of installed devices

The devices section contains the list of devices that will be managed. All devices contains three standard properties:

- accessory: the technical name of the device, should be one of the names listed in this document
- name: mnemonic name, will be displayed by iOS HomeKit application
- address: the MyHome address, usually in B/A/PL format for lights and curtaints or single/double digits for other devices. B stands for BUS (usually 0), A and PL is the name of the addressing object used by BTicino and stands for Ambient and Light Point (Punto Luce in the original italian version)

## Supported devices

* MHRelay: Standard (Lighting) Relay (eg. F411), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
  * this device supports the definition of a custom frame for on and off command, so you can specify frame\_on and/or frame\_off:

            {
            "accessory": "MHRelay",
            "name": "Bathroom Light",
            "address": "0/1/5",
            "frame_on": "*1*1*14##",
            "frame_off": "*1*0*14##"
            }
    
    to use a Group, CEN, CEN+ or other command to turn on and off that load, using the _address_ load for the status monitor. Remember that HomeKit will think that the load has changed the status after the command even if is not true.


* MHScene: Scene (F420) or IRBlaster, address is N, Scene is scenario number (thanks to dendeps) - NOT TESTED
* MHDimmer: Lighting Dimmer (eg. F427, F413N), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
* MHThermostat: Standard Thermostat controlled by a 99-Zones Central Station (code 3550), address is the Zone Identifier (1-99)
* MHExternalThermometer: External Probe controlled by a 99-Zones Central Station (code 3550), address is the Zone Identifier (1-9)
* MHOutlet: Standard (not-Lighting) Relay, address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10). See MHRelay for custom frame support
* MHBlind: Standard Automation Relay (eg. F411, I need to check the F401), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
  * this device defines another property called "time" that defines the configured "stop time" in seconds; using this property the driver can evaluate the current position of the blind
* MHBlindAdvanced: Advanced version of standard Blind (eg. F401 that manages internally the current position), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
* MHContactSensor: Dry Contact sensor (eg. 3477 or some burgalarm sensors), address range is 1-201
* MHPowerMeter: (WILL BE SUPPORTED)
* MHAlarm: (WILL BE SUPPORTED)
